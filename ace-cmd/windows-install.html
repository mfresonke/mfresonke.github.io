  <h1>Windows Install Instructions</h1>
  <h2>Download Cygwin</h2>
  <p>
    Most of you should download the <a href="setup-x86_64.exe">64-bit Installer</a>.
    <br/>
    However, some of you are sticking it out on 32-bit Windows, so you'll need the
    <a href="setup-x86.exe">32-bit Installer</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Install Some Packages</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to the base packages, you'll want to install the following:
    <ul>
      <li>gcc-core</li>
      <li>gcc-g++</li>
      <li>make</li>
      <li>gdb</li>
      <li>git</li>
      <li>wget</li>
      <li>fortune-mod</li>
      <li>perl</li>
      <li>openssh</li>
    </ul>
    You can use the search field to find these efficiently. I will demonstrate on the board how to install them.
    <br />
    Not all of these will be used today, but they are all useful.

  <h2>Download Fortune</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunutely, cygwin does not come with an absolutely essential program: cowsay. <small>(I kid, I kid.)</small>
    Click <a href="cowsay.zip">here</a> to download it.
