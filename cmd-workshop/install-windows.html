  <h1>OLD INSTRUCTIONS <small>Here only for archive. Everyone should use WSL.</small></h1>
	<h2>Cygwin Auto-Installer</h2>
  <h3>Download cygwin package</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="ACE-64-Cygwin-Setup.exe">64-bit Setup (Most Setups)</a></li>
      <li><a href="ACE-32-Cygwin-Setup.exe">32-bit Setup (For you holdouts!)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Await Max's Instructions</h3>
  <p>
    ;)
  </p>
  <h2>OLD OLD Windows Install Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Download Cygwin</h3>
  <p>
    Most of you should download the <a href="setup-x86_64.exe">64-bit Installer</a>.
    <br/>
    However, some of you are sticking it out on 32-bit Windows, so you'll need the
    <a href="setup-x86.exe">32-bit Installer</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Run Installer</h3>
  <p>
    Should be as easy as it sounds. When asked for the mirror, do the scientific thing and blindly choose one. <small>(That's what I do.)</small>
  </p>

  <h4>Install Some Additional Packages</h4>
  <p>
    When asked for additional packages, use the search feature to install and find the following:
    <ul>
      <li>gcc-core <small>(Devel)</small></li>
      <li>gcc-g++ <small>(Devel)</small></li>
      <li>make <small>(Devel)</small></li>
      <li>git <small>(Devel)</small></li>
      <li>wget <small>(Web)</small></li>
      <li>fortune-mod <small>(Games)</small></li>
      <li>perl <small>(Interpreters)</small></li>
      <li>nano <small>(Editors)</small></li>
      <li>figlet <small>(Text)</small></li>
      <li>espeak <small>(Audio)</small></li>
    </ul>
    You only need to click the "Bin" part for it to install.
    <br />
    If none of this makes sense (or even if it does), don't worry. I'll demonstrate on the board how to install it.
  </p>
  <h3>Download Cowsay</h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunutely, cygwin does not come with an absolutely essential program: cowsay. <small>(I kid, I kid.)</small>
    Click <a href="cowsay.zip">here</a> to download it.
  </p>
  <h4>Install Cowsay</h4>
  <p>
    Not gonna lie, this is the messyest part of the windows install process. Even so, I just couldn't give up the awesome learning power of the cow.
    <br />
    To install this beast, extract the .zip and drag the "usr" folder into your cygwin directory. This will be installed at your root (C:) drive.
    Accept any overwrite warnings, it's NBD.
  </p>
  <h2>Link Windows Home to Cygwin Home <small>(Technically optional, but you should really do it)</small></h2>
  <p>
    Open an "Administrative" Command Line Prompt. (Open start menu, type "cmd", right-click "Run As Administrator")
  </p>
  <h3>64-bit Command to Paste</h3>
    <code>mklink /D C:\cygwin64\home\%USERNAME%\win-home %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</code>
  <h3>32-bit Command to Paste</h3>
    <code>mklink /D C:\cygwin\home\%USERNAME%\win-home %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</code>

  <h3>C'Mon Max! I Wanna Learn this SH!</h3>
  <p>
    Well good! Because the setup is done for you Windoze peepz!
